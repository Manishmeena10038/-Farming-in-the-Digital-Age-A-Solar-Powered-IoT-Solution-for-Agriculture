# IOT-project

Smart Agriculture system using IOT is a project that helps farmers to increase the productivity of their crops and by saving time for the farmers. Life by making everything smart and intelligent. IoT refers to a network of things that make a self-configuring network. The development of Intelligent Smart Farming IoT-based devices is day by day turning the face of agriculture production by not only enhancing it but also making it cost-effective and reducing wastage. The aim  of this report is to propose  IoT based Smart Agriculture System assisting farmers in getting Live Data (Temperature, Soil Moisture) for efficient environment monitoring which will enable them to increase their overall yield and quality of products. The IoT-based Smart Farming System being proposed via this report is integrated with different Sensors and a Node MCU ESP8266 WIFI module producing live data feed that can be obtained online from Blynk Andriod App.
